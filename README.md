# Telegram Desktop Backups
Old binaries for [TelegramDesktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) (Referred to after as just "TDesktop")

Files in `TDesktop-*` are binaries copied from an existing install. You should be able to copy them directly over an existing install.

Files in `Setup` are setup files to install that version of TDesktop, mostly downloaded from [telegram-for-desktop.en.uptodown.com/old](http://telegram-for-desktop.en.uptodown.com/old), rather get them there if you can.
